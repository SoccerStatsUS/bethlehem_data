*Steel Workers Trip to Brazil Certain
*According to an announcement made by Secretary Thomas W. Cahill of the United States Football Association, the invasion of the Bethlehem Steel team to Brazil is certain, the tour to start next month for a series of games in that country during September. The trip was arranged by Ambassador Morgan at Rio de Janeiro and local officials. Secretary Cahill yesterday stated that the sanction of the Federation Internationale de Football for the Bethlehem tour of Brazil had been granted in a cablegram just received from C. A. W. Hirschman of Amsterdam, F. I. F. Secretary-Treasurer. The National Commission of the U. S. F. A. is now taking a mail vote to grant permission to the Bethlehem team to make the trip. The games in Brazil will be played under the auspices of the Brazilian Federations of Sports, and will be six or eight in number. The team will sail for Rio from New York, and games will be played in Rio, Bahia, Pernambuco, Sao Paulo and Santos.
*
*Tour Was Originally Planned For Last Season
*The trip to Brazil is the completion of plans formulated last season and which according to the original idea was to have followed the Steel Workers campaigning in Sweden and Denmark. In fact, the players left Bethlehem assured that they would tour South America and were somewhat disappointed when a cablegram reached them on board ship while en route to the Scandinavian countries calling it off. With an extensive schedule to be played in Sweden and Denmark, it was deemed unwise to make the final leg of the trip until this year. The decision was a wise one for it is remembered that the season in this country was well started before the Bethlehem players returned and in the opening games the men did not display their usual form. It is understood that several new men are expected to join the squad and that they will be included among the players on the trip.
*
*St. Louis Club Will Also Tour
*An all-star selection to represent St. Louis will leave Toronto, Canada, tomorrow on a trip that will take them to Europe and practically over the identical rout traveled by the Bethlehem Club last season. They will sail for Havre, France, aboard the Canadian-Pacific liner Tunisian. The middle-west aggregation will be reinforced with a delegation of eastern players, included in the party at the request of the Swedish Association. The players are: George J. Tintle, of Harrison, N. J., and Albert Blakey, of Philadelphia, both members of the 1916 international team and who also made the trip abroad with the Bethlehem team last summer. David Brown of Kearny, N. J.., Harry J. Ratican, St. Louis-born star of the Robins Dry Dock team of Brooklyn, and for three seasons leading goal scorer of the United States, and George Post, late of the Erie A. A., of Kearny, N. J. John J. Heminsley, of Paterson, was to have made the trip, his third to Europe under Cahill's direction, but difficulties have arisen at the eleventh hour and it is probable Charles H. Ellis of Woodside, L. I., a member of the 1916 international team, will be substituted at the last minute.
*
*Third American Team to go to Europe
*The St. Louis team is the third to go to Europe for soccer competition in five years and is the first such to be composed entirely of American-born players. Sixteen of the members were born in St. Louis and it is under the name of the St. Louis Football Club that the team will play overseas. Five or six countries will be visited, the schedule not being completed by the Swedish Football Association taking in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Czecho-Slovakia, Holland and possibly Belgium.

*Industrial Soccer for National Title
*Dissatisfaction was general in the National Soccer League last season and it would be little surprise if many of the clubs, including Bethlehem, failed to compete in that circuit next season. An Industrial League threatens to take the place of the National League and already has been effected. Sanction to operate such a series was granted the American Industrial Athletic Association at a recent meeting of the United States Football Association held in St. Louis. A survey of the soccer activities during the last season shows that about thirty strong industrial teams were on the field but no effort was made to match them in national competition. The caliber of these teams compared well with not only the best soccer organizations in the country, but American Industrial teams invaded Canada and defeated the best clubs there. The A. I. A. A. cup series this year will bet he first of its kind ever attempted and will no doubt meet with the general approval of all those fostering the sport. The matches it is proposed to play in an elimination series in which all teams competing must e members of the organization and registered with the State Association affiliated with the N. S. A. F. M. A. A beautiful trophy has been selected by the Industrial directors to be awarded to the team winning the national title.

* NATIONAL SOCCER LEAGUE AHS BEEN REORGANIZED
*Merchants and Disston Teams Dropped Because of Violating Rules
*8 CLUBS TO PLAY NEXT YEAR
*Meeting Held Saturday at Newark and Important Questions Settled
*The dissatisfaction in the ranks of the National Soccer League was somewhat smoothed over at a meeting of the circuit held in Newark on Saturday night and after lengthy discussions, reorganization was effected for the campaign next year.
*
*Before the session convened there were many who somewhat feared that the league would go into the discard, several of the clubs expressing a desire to drop out, while others were averse to continue if one or two of the clubs that violated the rules during the campaigning last season continued.
*
*All discussion was, however, straightened out after lengthy squabbling and the league officials will go ahead minus two of the teams, together with the assurance that the rules would be more stringently enforced next year.
*
*The award of the honors to the Bethlehem Club was undisputed. The two teams dropped were Merchants and Disstons, these two teams behaving as they liked last year and frequently failed to honor scheduled engagements. In this Bethlehem was quite frequently the goat, one occasion being when Merchants refused to come here for a game and on the same day played an exhibition contest in Philadelphia.
*
*The officials apparently realized that the actions of these two clubs were a severe hold-back and detriment to the game and it was deemed advisable to reorganize the league without including the two teams.
*
*The league organized with eight teams, as follows: Bethlehem, New York F. C., Paterson F. C., Federal Ship, Robins Dry Dock and Morse Dry Docks. In granting permission to Federals to continue, they were warned that this would be their last chance in the event of again violating the rules.
*
*William Sheridan, manager of athletics at the local plant of the Bethlehem Steel Co., was the representative of the Bethlehem F. C. Mr. Sheridan gained the league's permission for a trip to Brazil with the understanding that upon the return of the team the players were to be allowed seven days' grace before starting their league schedule.

*H. E. LEWIS TO WED MISS HELEN SANDERS, OF ST. PAUL
*Mrs. J. Howard Sanders, of St. Paul, Minn., announced the engagement of her daughter, Miss Helen W. Sanders, to H. Edgar Lewis of Bethlehem, Pa. The wedding will take place early in fall.

*Proposed Soccer Rules Changes
*The international board of Great Britain which governs the soccer football code, recently considered a proposition by Scotland that no player can be offside unless within twenty-five yards of the opposing goal. There was also a suggestion that no player can be offside at a free kick or a throw in. They are radical projects and the board ruling will be interesting even though it seems this country will not follow the lead of Great Britain in withdrawing from the International Federation
