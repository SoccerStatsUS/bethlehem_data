## Intro

This is a project to generate high quality data relating to the history of Bethlehem Steel FC, using newspaper articles transcribed from [bethlehemsteelsoccer.org]

Bethlehem Steel was one of the best soccer teams in the fist half of the 20th century, and while they were not well attended, the Bethlehem newspaper covered them quite well.
